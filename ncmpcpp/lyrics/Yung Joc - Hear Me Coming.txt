All the hoes lose they mind when they see me stuntin
Dope Boys lose they mind when they see me coming
All the haters get to runnin' when they hear that choppa drummin, Blllluuupp, blllluup bumpin

(Yung Joc)
Y'all ready know, ya ain't even gotta wonder
I was voted number one rapper to drop this summer
A one hit wonder, how the hell ya figure that?
My rhymes like crack, fiends screamin, "gimmie that!"
I'm being like a monkey, and that '73 dope
Need a desert eagle, reefer smellin like a skunk
Got a bitch named Judy, with a real big booty
Blue star keep a nigga riding cuji
If it's a problem, I suggest you let it go
Got some killas over there, more hellan than the lord
I beat the block up
You can hear me when I'm comin'
If it's a problem then the choppers start drummin, drummin

My niggas flip birds
Your niggas flip burgers
My niggas got work
Your niggas just workers
My niggas, we get hurt
Your niggas is unheard of
My niggas murder
Your niggas get murdered
My niggas win niggas
Your niggas get drenched
My niggas play the field
Your niggas ride bench
My niggas is quarterbacks
Your niggas just receive
With a single flinch boy, your niggas retreat
My niggas take the coke and they let the shit cook
Your niggas experiment with dope and get hooked
Now ain't that something, let the story get told
As the plot thickens and the script unfolds

I get back around three
We can do it more again
Message to them hater middle finger to the wind
Let my chain swang, with a limp in my walk
Baby hush ya mouth, respect a pimp when he talk
Everybody know that I do it for the hood
Help feed the hungry, now my homies all good
Word on the street, Joc got the heat
Suede on the seat, 28's on the feet
Two bottle of Crys, baby go on spend money
When ya add it up now I'm drinkin' red money
My wrist gone froze
Make 'em jump out of they clothes
Go ahead drink tonight, cuause tomorrow you gotta go

Ha ha ha, nigga
