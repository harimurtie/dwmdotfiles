Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all

Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time - it waits for nobody

You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong (gone wrong gone wrong)
You know what's going on
But it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all (confided in each other at all)
It seems that we've all got our backs against the wall

(Time) Time waits for nobody
(Time) waits for no-one
We've got to trust in one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
(Time)

Yeah - Time waits for nobody
No no - Time don't wait for no-one
Let's learn to be friends with one another
Or there'll be no more future at all

Time (time) time (time) waits for nobody waits for nobody
Time time time time waits for nobody at all

Time waits for nobody - yeah
Time don't wait - waits for no-one
Let us free this world for ever
And build a brand new future for us all

Time waits for nobody nobody nobody
For no-one
