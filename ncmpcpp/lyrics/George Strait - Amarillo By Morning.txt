Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I got
Is just what I've got on
When that sun is high
In that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo, I'll be there

They took my saddle in Houston
Broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend
Somewhere along the way
But I'll be looking for eight
When they pull that gate
And I hope that
Judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's on my mind

Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I got
Is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime
But what I got is mine
I ain't rich
But Lord, I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be

Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
